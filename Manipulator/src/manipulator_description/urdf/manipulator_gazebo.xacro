<!--

A control plugin in Gazebo + ROS 2 is the bridge that connects your robot’s joints to ROS2 controllers (like JointTrajectoryController, PositionController, etc.)

It is absolutely required if you want to move your robot in Gazebo using ROS 2.

Let me explain in the simplest way.

🧠 What is a control plugin? (Simple explanation)

Think of your robot’s joints as motors.

Think of ROS 2 controllers as the remote control.

A control plugin is the wire that connects the remote to the motors.

Without the plugin:

controllers cannot send commands to Gazebo

joints will not move

/joint_states will not be published

MoveIt will not work

🎯 What exactly does the control plugin do?
1. Reads joint positions/velocity from Gazebo

✔ Feeds them to ROS 2
✔ Publishes /joint_states

2. Receives commands from ROS 2

✔ e.g. position, velocity, effort
✔ Sends them to the Gazebo physics engine
✔ Moves the joints

3. Applies real physics

✔ torque limits
✔ joint friction
✔ inertia
✔ constraints
